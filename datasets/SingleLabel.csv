Now looky here, my big ideas
Gonna get me in trouble now amongst my peers
But have no fear, no bother cry tears
You're just miles ahead when I'm ahead light years

Anywhere me go, dem roll out red carpet
Some man a buy car and nah no house fi park it
Nah unify dem selfish like market
Dem sell out dem souls just to be rewarded
Bleach out dem skin, dem favour dead to rahtid
Soul too corrupt and dem blemish and faulted
Real Rastaman we cannot be outsmarted
Gong's not the one fi a bwoy take chance with
Ancient Nazarite weh make the Red Sea parted
Provide the harvest, in drought and shortage

So buy your tickets to the show, get there early grab a seat
The real Gong is in the house, everything else counterfeit
If I have not been around, it's a part of my mystique
I've been busy so to speak, I've been winning on a streak
I've been feeling like a Wednesday, surrounded by the week
Be strong alone continue, fi di justice where we seek
So doh follow some DJ cah dem swimming up a creek
Dem inna deeper shit when time dem an dem maker meet
And if you buy the bullshit, then don't lose your receipt
Them bound fi self destruct, mi ago lowe dem, mek you see it
Dem sow weh dem a reap, dem think say Jah no seet
When the stage show full a demon and the club dem full a freak
And the dancehall full a pagans and dance like dem a Greek
Dem renk and dem a reek, dem pop down one a week
Dem always overdweet, but turn the other cheek
The earth is for the meek, huh

First Grammy at 23, tell me which one a dem do that
Another tour at 27, add it up and do the maths

The Mission UK,Rock,Jade,Another Fall from Grace,2016.0,"She came as Lolita dressed as Venus
And adorned with Stars
With her deft allusion and a Universe between Us
She showed me her skill with words and I showed her my Scars
Don't mistake kindness for affection, she said
Don't ever let the attention go to your Head
No more let Death divide what Life can join Together
But just remember there is nothing that can last Forever
And Jade is Benediction
She is silent Prayer
And Jade is Exaltation
The colours that I wear
And Jade is Contradiction
She is naked but never bare
Jade is a Work, a work of Fiction
Nothing more than Castles in the Air
The shorter the leash the harder I will pull
My glass is Empty when once it was Full
I wish I could be Jesus and turn water into Wine
'Cause all my grapes have withered, withered on the vine
With a smile like Mercury, elusive and fey
There's a Beauty in the night that can't be seen by day
She's a barbed wire Angel insatiable and cruel
She destroys my resistance like the most Dazzling Jewel
And Jade is Apostasy
Abandoned Faith and Hope
Jade is Hypocrisy
She is Kaleidoscope
And Jade is Precious Stone
Impervious and Rare
And Jade will never atone
For the Flowers in her Hair
And Jade never sleeps alone
There's always someone there
With Jade
To rest their Head on her thigh
To make her moist when she is dry
To hold the Breath of every sigh
To pledge their Life and how to Die
To kiss the sleep from her Eyes
To dry the Tears when she Cries
And Jade is all and Jade is None
And Jade is Moon and she is Sun
And Jade is You and Everyone
And she is Me and and all I've done
And Jade is Lost and she is Won
And Jade is the Bullet shot from your Gun ...",Tenderness

Waiting for the manna coming from the west
Barren is her bosom, empty as her eyes

Skin and bones is creeping, doesn't know he's dead
Ancient eyes are peeping, from his infant head
Politicians argue sharpening their knives
Drawing up their bargains, trading baby lives

Hear the angels singing, what is that they say?
Eat and drink rejoicing, joy is hear to stay

If you Quest from the Soul, here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun, lots of fun together

Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close

Long lovin' lets Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— 

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever

Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed – what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works.""

Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner.""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins.""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord.""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe you raised Him from the dead.""
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life.""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior.""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life.""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward.""
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
""Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood.""
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)

Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style deteriorate rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwing your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up if you mastered addition
Where I come from, getting visuals is habitual
You're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, formed a mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it was plural
Rhyming while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparalleled advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk
I smoke the bead of the skunk, tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk, your head get shrunk
Your treasure sunk, I be fucking bitches by the chunk
My name black, you worms wanna play in my dirt

Unglove the noose, watch a nigga transfuse

Sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than Kinko
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
And we return like Jesus when the whole world need us

Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through (Shiver for me)

Garth Brooks,Country,That Summer,The Chase,1993.0,"I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing somethin' from each other
Not knowin' yet what that might be

'Til she came to me one evenin'
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

That summer wind was all around me
Nothin' between us but the night
And when I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in each others eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancin' with the wind
Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night",Tenderness

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times
I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me
Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And, I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side
Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right

A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With loves and hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived
And then they died
Seems so unfair
I want to cry

You say: ""'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn""
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times
(maybe less, maybe more)

If you must write prose and poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take ""on loan""
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall

You say: ""'Ere long done do does did""
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text
From whence was ripped
(Some dizzy whore, 1804)

Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war

I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up, underneath
This heavy burden

There's a halo in the distance

Up in smoke with the fire we started

Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow

I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home

In an empty bed with an hour to kill

Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it

Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen

For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it

Fly ass bro, liver than coke

Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill

Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in

Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper

Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime

Broke the record flowing without any knowing

The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over
And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again
But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
Screaming it over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams

To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date."" — ""Looks like an olive to me.""
""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists.""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners",Tension

Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb

Can never cut below the floor

But our procession lurches on
As if we had recovered
Draconian winter unforetold
One solar day, suddenly you're old
Your little envelope just makes me cold
Makes destination start to unfold
Our documents are useless
Or forged beyond believing
Page forty-seven is unsigned
I need it by this evening
In the space between our cities
A storm is slowly forming
Something eating up our days
I feel it every morning

It's not a religion, it's just a technique
It's just a way of making you speak
Distance and speed have left us too weak
And destination looks kind of bleak
Our elements are burned out
Our beasts have been mistreated

Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh

Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
Sing as you raise your bow (Ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back

At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes!
Ahhhhh
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back

N.W.A,Hip-Hop,Fuck tha Police,Straight Outta Compton,1988.0,"Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are; MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit ‘cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in L.A
Yo, Dre, I got something to say

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
‘Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit!
A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke them now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
(Gunshot sounds)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say…

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

(Knocking sounds)
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open out!
Aww, shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
(Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say

Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

The verdict:
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chickenshit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here!
I want justice!
Get him the fuck out my face!
I want justice!
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

The coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time
To prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy
But folks just called him yellow
Something always told me
They were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old
When his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy
Cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words
My brother said to Tommy
Son my life is over, but yours has just begun

Promise me, son
Not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek
And I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

There's someone for everyone
And Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have
To prove he was a man
One day while he was working
The Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky
N'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door
And saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look
Was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace
Took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face
He heard these words again

Promise me, son
Not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek
And I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up
And met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said
""Hey look, old yella's leavin'""
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling
Was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back
He let 'em have it all
Tommy left the bar room
Not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, ""This one's for Becky""
As he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say

I promised you, Dad
Not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak
I didn't turn the other cheek
Papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight
When you're a man

Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith

Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'

It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out

Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried

And...stop apologising for the things you've never done
'Cos time is short and life is cruel
But it's up to us to change
This town called Malice
Rows and rows of disused milk floats
Stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives
Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing
When tears come fast and furious
In a town called Malice
Struggle after struggle, year after year
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice
I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called Malice
A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids' new gear
It's a big decision in a town called Malice
The ghost of a steam train echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going 'round and 'round
Playground kids and creaking swings
Lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will
But I'd sooner put some joy back

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

If not himself, then he has not

It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Dripping wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on

That lay smoking in his hand
She said, ""Father please forgive me
I can't make it without my man""

And she knew she couldn't win

And then throw it all away
Oh I'll throw it all away

Like throwing arms round yesterday

Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do

I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke and make-believe ran out

What's wrong with your hair right now?
Well you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails done too
Look, I'mma tell you like this

I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin up in em
But you know, I'm a menace to society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to 'em, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See, they think we narrow minded
'Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say ""How ya doin'?""
See, I'm only down for screwin', but you know
Ya gotta play it off cool
'Cause if they catch you slipping, you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know you're getting their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show em off
But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give
And no take
Run out of money, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
'Cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it
Messing with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Ice Cube, girl, 'cause I ain't the one

Girrrrrl, you got to get these brothers for all the money you can honey. 'Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't do nothin' for me but get out of my face
I know what you mean, girl; it ain't nothin' right jumpin' off unless he got dollars!

Sometimes I used to wonder
How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number
He's getting juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nuttin' of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say
I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A

You know I spell girl with a B
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no
Flowers to your doorstep, when we goin out
'Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt
And after the date, I'mma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster, huh? I'm thinking Burger King
And when I take you, you get frustrated
You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts
It start comin' out the pocket, to knock it
But when the damage is done
You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one

I don't care how they look; if they got money, we can hook up but they ain't gettin' none
Yeah, I just make em think they gonna get some, play with they mind a lil bit, and get that money. Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?

Give you money? Why bother?
'Cause you know I'm looking nothing like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Ganked means getting took for your bank
Or your gold or your money or something
Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing
They get mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see if my knowledge is effective
To the brothas man they robbing you blind
'Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself, homie
And if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave 'em and love and stay above 'em
I used to get no play; now she stay behind me
'Cause I said I had a Benz 190
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some; now she feels dumb
To my homies it's funny
But that's what you get trying to play me for my money
Now don't you feel used?
But I don't give a hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal
Now how many times do I have to say it?
'Cause if I have to go get a gun
You girls will learn I don't burn
You think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one

Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good.""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it.""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Wu-Tang Clan,Hip-Hop,Triumph,Wu-Tang Forever,1997.0," / 

What? Y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me?
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This like, this '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight, incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan
Into the fire, transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back
In the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot
And blow spots, you want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team and your ""six can't rhyme"" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your thought is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell, globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings

March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat basslines on Novation
Getting drunk like I'm fucking ducking five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for the acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo yo yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali, came in threes
We like the Genovese, sazon season these degrees
It's Earth, 93 million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor, word tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, Lex, the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland",Sadness

For the small chronic break?

Taking bitches out to eat, and spending money on these hoes

I tell a bitch like this:
""Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without Bluenotes
You'll never go platinum!""

I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggas know who I am, y'all niggas tearin' up shit
But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics
It's like everywhere I lizzook
And everywhere I go
I'm hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, cause, see, my homie Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the door

Some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-whack
I still got the biggest sack!
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
Hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize
And see where I'm coming from: it's still Eastside
Til I die. Why ask why?
As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G, Y

It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World

Well if you give me 10 bitches then I'll fuck all 10
Seen the homie Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packing flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that something?
Talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
1, 2, 3: you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, It's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm coming from L.A
She used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that ho
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I’m dishin out blues, I’m upsettin' like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it’s on, I’m head huntin'
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9’s for some action
You really don’t know, do you, you fuckin' wit a hog
You can’t do me, I’m goin' out looney like O-Dog

It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)
Til when? (Til the early morn')
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
For tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dough

Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once more
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
Til I die, I'm still screaming out: ""bitches ain't shit!""
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he not known about
The city where I'm from: Dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D
The gangster clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangster funk

Then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new
I want to stroll over Heaven with you

So many places of beauty we long to see here below
But time and treasures have kept us from making plans as you know
But come the morning of rapture together we'll stand a new
While I stroll over Heaven with you",Tenderness

This woman's a thrill and I'm so curious, but I already know
She's a man killer, pulling me in
And I'm losing my mind
She's got a sex appeal beyond imagination
And she knows how to use it to get what she wants
Using her body and emotion
And she's using it well, using it well
She makes me want to want her
Want to want her, want to want her
She's pulling me in, pulling me in
Want to want her, want to want her
Pulling me in, pulling me in
Using the art of seduction
Watching the way she moves
She gets me in the mood
Makes me feel hot inside
Baby, just let me ride
I like the things you do
So why don't you do them to me?
You got me going crazy
Baby, baby, baby
And she knows how to use it to get what she wants
Using her body and emotion
And she's using it well, using it well
She makes me want to want her

Perhaps the most famous classic in all the world of music—""
The first time around, you didn't quite understand our new style of

(Don't worry, we can fix that right now)
So why don't you all just grab your bags
(Come on aboard, hoist the anchor, and we'll be off)
(And good luck to both of you)
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One

Answering any other service
Perogative praised positively I'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my ability
After the battle they admit that I'm with it
Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue
Transistors are never more shown with
Like wind, vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called plug tunin'

(""Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm"")

Flock to the preacher called Pos
Let him be the stir to the style of your stew
Sit while the kid of the Plug form aroma
Then grab a Daisy to sip your favorite brew
Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior
But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe
See that the three will be your thread
But like my man Chuck D said, 'What a brother know'
Dance while I play and the cue cards sway
From my flower girls China and Jette
The button is pressed in '89 we'll start the panic
From De La Soul and a Prince from Stet
Negative noise will be all divided
Dangerous to dance, Posdnuos will croon
Ducks and kizids will all be rid
When paying position to the naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'

Brothers of the Soul who present a new flick
Every last viewer is tuned to the method
Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick
Bitten by the spoken who been titled Plug Two
Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz
Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth
To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative
Flow to the sway cause I say fa-so-la-ti
At the top we will dwell
Difference is fame and we rise then we build
Where we are set we get fat and we swell
Motions of the Soul is a positive stride
One step forward is the space we consume
Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume
How the Soul found the motto of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'

Vocal is local so believe that
This chant sends L.I. on the strong map
Trying and live so you best realize
That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap
Style of the Tune is personal
And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all
Stop, sit and study cause the meaning isn't muddy
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all
Watch while the pitcher is pitching
Cause this is the pitch of the year
Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong
Though you heard Dove crying, I ain't fearing
Those who think De La's on the flip tip
Try to flip this and you're doomed
Watch for the B-B cause if you try to grieve me
You'll be hung by the wire of the Plug Tune

De La Soul,Hip-Hop,Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa,De La Soul is Dead,1991.0,"""If you will suck my soul
I will lick your funky emotions""

This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly
But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie
Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly
Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly
Around this time the slammin' joint was “Milk is Chillin'”
But even cooler was my social worker Dillon
Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles
Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles
He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races
That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces
She had the curves that made you wanna take chances
I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances
I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'
I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing
At the time no one knew but it was a shame
That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game

Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'
On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin'
You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'
Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'
Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you
He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you?
You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool
Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school
He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey
He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's
Child, ya got the best pops anyone could have
Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad

Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon
But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain
While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom
And he would toss her and then would force her to give him head room
Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen
But when she'd fuss, he would just commence the slappin'
(Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's the deal?)
I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal
Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him
And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em
And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'
How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him
When I got home, I found she had tried to call me
My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry)
I tried to call the honey but her line was busy
I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon

I received a call from Misses Sick herself
I asked her how was she recoverin' her health
She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute
She wanted to talk serious, I said, ""go ahead-shoot""
She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile
Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol
That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one
She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one
Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates
Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits
There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip
He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip
You're just mad he's your overseer at school
No need to play him out like he's someone cruel
She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else
Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self

Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses
And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes
Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother
He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother
As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie
I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?""
I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'
She shouts to Dill, “He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!”
None of the kids could understand what was the cause
All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus
Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to
Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to
Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over",Sadness

Dr. Dre: So what you want me to do? ... (Express yourself)

I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing
But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel

That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...

Express yourself
Come on and do it

From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight

I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, ""It's time for bed""

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

You can do what you want, just keep it out of my neighborhood
Personally I think the lyrics are a bit too harsh
I ain't no nigga, fuck that shit
Does everything come out your mouth got to be a 4-letter word?
All over this bullshit, it's just a bunch of fuckin' noise
The way you talk about women is bullshit, plain bullshit
What you motherfuckers doin' for the black community anyway?
Motherfucker I got kids, I don't want 'em listenin' to that bullshit
{*hospital monitor starts beeping*}
Fuck the niggas!
Motherfuckers need to stop
How can you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it?
{*monitor stops beeping - R.I.P.*}
 Flatline
 Bullshit!

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Well it's because motherfuckers wanna blast me
And run me outta my neighborhood
And label me as a dope dealer yo, and say that I'm no good
But I gave out jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out
Gave em some dope and a corner so they could show out
When the cops came, they gave a fake name
Because the life in the streets is just a head game
So therefore, to make more
A 15-year-old black kid'll go and rob a liquor store
And get shot in the process
He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
I guess it's just the way shit has to be
Back when I was young gettin' a job was murder
Fuck flippin' burgers, cause I deserve a
Nine-to-five I can be proud of, that I can speak loud of
And to help a nigga get out of
Yo! The concrete playground
But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
But I'm a smart motherfucker you see
One of the best producers in the rap music industry
Gettin' paid like a motherfucker
A young brother, who don't give a fuck about another
Yeah

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me
Every time that I'm rollin
They swear up and down that the car was stolen
Make me get face down in the street
And throw the shit out my car on the concrete
In front of a residence
A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Because my mouth is so motherfuckin' nasty
Bitch this, bitch that, nigga this, nigga that
In the mean while my pockets are gettin' fat
Gettin' paid to say this shit here
Makin' more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
So why not call myself a nigga?
It's better than pullin' the trigger and goin' up the river
And then I get called a nigga anyway
Broke as a motherfucker and locked away, so
So cut out all that bullshit

Then hear about it later in a verse I curse
Because I'm real with this to keep my shit straight bumpin

I live it, I see it, and I write it because I know it
And if you think I'm fuckin' your wife
You're motherfuckin' right yo, cause I'm a nigga for life

I love niggas, I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love that you niggas (""niggas for life"")

The actual fact is that I'm black and bound to attract
The attention of another, I mean the other
But I'm a motherfucker that'll have 'em runnin' for cover
You see, I don't give a fuck about nothin'
Except gettin' paid, gettin' bitches, and issuin' stitches
Which is, all needed to read it and find a rhyme
And then it's time to say, the nigga's here to stay
But what about the fake niggas, the house niggas
To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
But N.W.A. is outta your motherfuckin' range
We ain't gonna change a motherfuckin' thang!

I call myself a nigga cause my skin won't lighten
I call myself a nigga cause the shit that I'm writin
Hypes me, hypes other motherfuckers around me
And that's the reason why they wanna surround me
And ask me - why do I call myself a negro?
Ain't none of their fuckin' business cause I'll let the trigger go

Miranda Lambert,Country,Mama’s Broken Heart,Four the Record,2013.0,"I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, all I know I couldn’t stop

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together

And blame is not a one way street
The widest avenue

And my belief is harm will come to you
Between the lines I think you'll find
Lessons learned from alleys blind
Beauty can turn sour
So recognise through all the lies
The hero of the hour, the hour
And I dream one day I'll find

I wander as the gypsy under a beckoning moon
Speak of time, and another face

From the cradle to the grave love to desire and crave

Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me

Your promises, are as pure as the driven snow
Passing shapes in the night the touch distraut and light
As you brightly shine, your love tonight is mine

Hmmmmmmmmm..

Get it all baby
Get it all baby
Get it all baby
(What you want me to do with it?)
Don't matter just don't bite it
(""She swallowed it"")
Suck this dick for daddy
(""She swallowed it"")
Juicin' at the lips
(""She swallowed it"")
It's the world's biggest dick
(What do you want me to do with it?)
Don't matter just don't bite it

Slow is the tempo - now talkin' but a nympho
So peep it out here goes the info
This is a bitch that did the whole crew
She get it so much we make bets on who the ho would love to go through
And for the shit that she does, give her a drum roll
Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
And she'll let you videotape her
And if you got a gang of niggas, the bitch would let you rape her
She likes suckin' on dicks, and lickin' up nut
And they even take the broomstick up the butt
Just to say that she did it with a rapper
But the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
""But how many licks would it take,"" she asks
""To make MC Ren start gooshin' up vanilla shakes?""
She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top
Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very irresistable
I couldn't pay the bitch to quit
Cuz the ho' was doin' some ol' crazy shit
That made me start havin' a fit'
Cuz the bitch sucked a hellified dick 


Now one night I was at a drive-in
And a car full of niggas straight drove in
I thought they wuz commin' to start trouble but no
Five niggas in the bucket with the neighborhood ho'
Now what do you expect they're gonna dogg her like a doggy
Thirty minutes later and the windowz all were foggy
And I'm off in my car havin' a fit cuz the bitch that I'm with
Said no fuckin' on the first date, shit
And I'm like Damn! I wish I was in the bucket
To be the sixth nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it
So I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar
And got the fuck out the car
Went to the bucket and I looked through the window
It was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo
And my turn was like next
I couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest
I wanted to see the face, I felt I oughtta
Peep over the seat, Oh shit! It's the preacher's daughter!
And she's only 14 and a ho'
But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro
She looked at me, I was surprised
But wasn't passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' baptized
I told the bitch to do it quick
You little ho' hurry up and suck my dick!


Now I'm a break it down with a fact
Since the last ""Just don't bite it"" girls don't know how to act
Sayin' that they never would suck a dick
But when they've tried it they couldn't quit
Cuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit
And those are the main ones that say they don't do it
But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it
So fellas, next time they try to tell a lie
That they never suck a dick, punch a bitch in the eye
And then the ho' will fall to the ground
Then you'll open up her mouth
Put your dick in and move the shit around
And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own
Actin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone
And then she won't let go
Because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano
Get the last drop, unclogging the pipe
Then the stupid bitch is out doing that same shit the next night
Because she just can't quit
Cuz she's addicted, addicted, she's addicted, addicted
She's addicted to suck a good dick",Sadness

To be so in love with you and so alone

Make it part of you to be a part of me
Follow me up and down

Take my hand and say you'll follow me

You know it's been a long, long time
I've tried to find the way that I can make you understand
The way I feel about you
And just how much I need you
To be there where I can talk to you
When there's no one else around
Follow me where I go, what I do, who I know
Make it part of you to be a part of me
Follow me up and down

Take my hand and say you'll follow me
You see I'd like to share my life with you
And show you things I've seen
Places that I'm going to
Places where I've been
To have you there beside me
To never be alone
And all the time that you're with me

Living out my passions, hopes, and fantasies

The one with the glint in her eyes
The girl that seldom loses
Beautiful, with grace and style
Acting out her story
Standing in her glory
Happy ever after

Wish I had a nickel for each dime I've spent
Watching others live their lives with confidence
Here's a preview of some things to come
It's not too late for me to be someone
I can't keep living in their make-believe
Coming attractions will be starring me

I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises, I live, I learn
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven
That corner every 15 minutes it move a seven
Pure snow, bag it then watch it go
Occupational options, get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the bowl or the strap, learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce
That 007, that 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, I love it''

You're the reason that I'm moving it with no hesitation

Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop
Graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots
I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word, balls and my instinct
I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think
We already on top, I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions, game changing mission
Big risks, big wins, equal bigger living
Perfect position, watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky

Learn from treacherous bibles
Of murder, hate and war
Searching for the tears

And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail

And the winds are blowing wild
Sweeping over cross and creed, country, colour and child

Her children lost at sea
And as the waves take me away
Say a prayer for liberty

For so persecute they the prophets before you and me

Even if the flames is getting hotter & hotter
Every one should know I don't believe in rumor
Children arise from your sleep & slumber
Don't come to bow, come to conquer
Strictly love why you envy your brother
Don't let them re-arrange you in a different manner

Her husband held it in and held her tight
Cancer don’t discriminate or care if you’re just 38
With three kids who need you in their lives
He said, ""I know that you’re afraid and I am, too
But you’ll never be alone, I promise you""

When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can’t take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it

She made it through the surgery fine
They said they caught it just in time
But they had to take more than they planned
Now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
To hide what the cancer took from her
But she just wants to feel like a woman again
She said, ""I don't think I can do this anymore""
He took her in his arms and said ""That's what my love is for""

When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes

Ever we want without new rules
And we'll share what's lost and what we grew

Something beginning with 'S'

On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning

Won't be any harm""

And moving lips to breathe her name

And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are

Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives
Could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call, there's albums to drop
There's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom
Confusing me with questions like...

Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright

De La Soul,Hip-Hop,I Am I Be,Buhloone Mindstate,1993.0,"I am Shortie
I be 4'11""

I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
The pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
Product of a North Carolina cat
Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie
Who departed life just a little too soon
And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame
As we go a little somethin' like this
Look ma, no protection
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monet
And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay
I am an early bird but the feathers are black
So the apples that I catch are usually all worms
But it's a must to decipher one's queen
From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ
I cherish the twilight
I maximize, my soul is the right size
I watch for the power to run out on the moon
(And that'll be sometime soon)
Faker than a fist of kids
Speakin that they're black
When they're just niggas trying to be Greek
Or some tongues who lied
And said ""We'll be natives to the end""
Nowadays we don't even speak
I guess we got our own life to live
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule?
Every now and then I step to the now
For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool
Now I won't apologize for it
This is not a bunch of Bradys
But a bunch of black man's pride
Yet I can safely say
I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside
I've always walked the right side of the road
If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs
But a man with a plan
And if I was a rug cleaner
Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am

The Plug Two brand with the flavour
In the flute watch the sniffin'
So a sack of shows in demand
I read the diction from the second page
I got the one-two gauge
Baritone to the izm fan
Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink
So let me need ya to my ems go
I push the infinite and carry it
My carrier's the three over one
So my pluggins already know
Lick shots with moo
Catch the boo
From a ghost in the heckling crowd
If I give a foot
Jack Ville caught a spill
When a still came from my mouth
I brought a head down south
I don't check for the noose and the neck
So I never tell my ems
That finesse is knocking at my door
I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun
And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore
I bring the element H with the 2
So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade
It's just mind over matter
And what matters is
That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade
I keep the walking on the right side
But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong
Cuz that's how he wants to be
No difference, see
I wanna be like the name of this song I am

I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
The pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
The deeds of a natural
Are seeds that are no longer planted
So the famine in the mind is strong
Tactics of another plane is now proven sane
Sane enough to let you know from within this song
I stabilize many cableized viewers
So my occupation's known
But not why I occupy
And that is to bring the peace
Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am",Sadness

Kenny Chesney,Country,The Good Stuff,"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems",2002.0,"Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
A corner bar, and it just seemed right
So I pulled up

Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: ""What'll it be?""
I said: ""The good stuff""

He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said: ""You can't find that here

Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

He said ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
Because that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff""",Tenderness

Dolly Parton,Country,Red Shoes,Dumplin’ (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),2018.0,"I remember as a child
I was absolutely wild
'Bout some red shoes that my aunt Lucy wore
She would let me stomp around
In those high heels up and down
'Round the house and 'round the wraparound porch

And from that moment on
I've had a pair of my own
They make me feel at home and brand new
They build my confidence
As if they've been heaven sent
I feel alone, I'm puttin' on my red shoes

I begged mama, ""Pretty please
From the wishbook order me
A pair of red shoes for my feet"", so mama did
Through the years I've thought about
Aunt Lucy's love and think of how
Such little things in life can make or break a kid

I believe that every child
Needs to feel a sense of pride
And someone to love and guide and see them through
So many miles I've traveled
Many times they've come unraveled
On the road both smooth or gravel
But I've made it through, ooh

Hell and half of Georgia
Or walkin' through New Orleans
Walk the streets of Memphis bowlin'
Stroll around a block or two
And if God sees fit to hold me
Anyone that's ever known me
Know I'd walk the gold streets only
In a pair of red shoes

And if I ever get to heaven
If I ever get to heaven
If I ever get to heaven
And Lord I hope I do
I will walk the streets of glory
I will walk the streets of glory
I will tell my Lucy story

Them visits ain't doin the trick, drop fucks make me sick

Turned around backwards so the windshield shows

Still, it's so much clearer

It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
Of recklessness and water
They cannot see me naked
These things, they go away
Replaced by everyday

Nightswimming, remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit
Around the fairest sun?
That bright, tight forever drum
Could not describe nightswimming

Underneath my breath

And I can judge the cover 'cause I wrote the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains
One, two, three..

And bless your heart as a negative
If you ride your white horse like the wind
If what you see is what you get

Ain't no new rap in my ear, too many depressed niggas
Emotional every song, deserve to have breast niggas
Crying 'bout my old girl, funny how I left niggas
Trying to get my ex boxed, Red Ring of Death niggas
I'm Kanye raising the diamond on the day of his chaining
If this was you, your diamond wouldn't be worth the appraising
I'm just talking reckless, I'm just off the record
But I mean it, kept my blessings

Find your joy, let go of the past
Love invade your walls like the Trojan horse again
Can't give up, won't give in, find the strength from within
Ask yourself, can you lose my heart again?
I know you're hurting but baby let my love set you free

Where they are now
Who they married
How many kids they have
She knew their backgrounds
Family and friends
A few she even talks to now and then
But there is one she can't put her finger on
There is one who never leaves her thoughts

And she thinks his name was John

A chance meeting
A party a few years back
Broad shoulders and blue eyes
His hair was so black
He was a friend of friend you could say
She let his smile just sweep her away
And in her heart
She knew that it was wrong
But too much wine
And she left his bed at dawn

And she thinks his name was John

Now each day is one day that's left in her life
She won't know love, have a marriage or sing lullabies
She lays all alone and cries herself to sleep
Because she let a stranger kill her hopes and her dreams
And all her friends say what a pity what a loss
And in the end when she was barely hanging on

All she could say was she thinks his name was John
And she thinks his name was John",Sadness

And some will say there's much more weight to pull

A little creek, a tree, an old rope swing
Cotton candy clouds against the blue

Raging like fire within
Tossing your heart to chance
You swear the dance will never end

But then it does and someone says goodbye
And after all those empty nights you cried
The morning that you wake up good as new

Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha

I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin’ out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe, cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I’m bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit and run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry bout it we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind

He said, ""It's cold out here and I'm all alone
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon and honey is there something wrong?""

She said, ""Don't bother coming home
By the time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.""
He said, ""I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say

Natural juices, so therapeutic

When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay

Swell up this shit, like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas, and attacking
Like apes in the cut, I’m waiting for the taking
While I break niggas neck, like a bracelet (fuck!)

Apparently, there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick, so irate
With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? 'Cause I'm lit—narrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway
With his personal memoir, saying ""He's bi!""
Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
Making him cry, ""Rape!""—then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade
""Yay! Yippee-Ki-Yay!"", 'cause here I—
Wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
And should I take it as a sign
Maybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)
I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger
To take the attention away
From my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing
The kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication, of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction, 'cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen
Who raps nasally? Eyes hazely?
Rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may
Need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
""Hey, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?""
You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down, faggot
See me on a ballot, I'm running for class clown
Rich Democrat bitch, so I'm just the candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus, on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age? I am—eight!
So let's get smashed and wake up the next day
With the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashed
Champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
Shady for president ho, don't make me go take it back
To the days of old, with Sway & Tech radio
When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show
Fuck you telling me, fools?
I was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in Drew's
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down, like a sick pet
You're fucking with vets, dog, fucking internet bloggers
""I sit in front of my computer all day
And comment on everything, I'm an expert on everything, Everything sucks—play the next song!""
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong
Son of God; I'm the S.O.G
Like a wet log, pores never get clogged
'Cause I'm so full of self-esteem, that I sweat fog
Yes, yes, y’all (Wah!)—steady on the left, y’all
Step off, 'fore you get stepped on
Soft? 'Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet
Jealousy’ll get you green as a Chia Pet
I can see that you’re visibly upset, dog
Alert, alert, girl—alert
Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt
So (""Jump around! Jump! Jump!"")
Get that ass shaking (""Jump around! Jump!"")
Came to hit you, with a fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach better get them arms
And freaking hands flailing and (""Jump!"")
Like Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success, than I am of failure
So what does that tell ya?
That on a grand scale, I don’t give a fuck about nothing
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing

""You are just what the doc ordered.""

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Sadness

Start building up your walls and never let her get inside

And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong

As you did last night
Underneath the city lights
There walking with your friend
Laughing at the moon
I swear you looked right through me
But I'm still living with your goodbye
And you're just going on with your life

How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all

You, I hear you're doing fine
Seems like you're doing well
As far as I can tell
Time (time) is leaving us behind (leaving us behind)
Another week has passed
And still I haven't laughed yet
So tell me what your secret is
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
To letting go, letting go like you did, like you did

How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall

Did you forget the magic?
Did you forget the passion? (Passion)
Did you ever miss me
Ever long to kiss me?

I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras

Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405

But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him

Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rocking Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back

I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back (I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend

I get out, you can't hold me in these chains
I'll get out, Father free me from this bondage
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change

Your stinking resolution is no type of solution
Preventing me from freedom, maintaining your pollution
I won't support your lie no more
I won't even try no more
If I have to die, oh Lord, that's how I choose to live
I won't be compromised no more
I can't be victimized no more
I just don't sympathize no more, ‘cause now I understand
You just wanna use me
You say ""love"" then abuse me
You never thought you'd lose me
But how quickly we forget that nothin' is for certain
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'
Your guilt trip's just not workin', repressin' me to death
‘Cause now I'm choosin' life, yo
I'll take the sacrifice, yo
If everything must go, then go: that's how I choose to live

Heh… hehehehehe…
Ok, we gettin' there
At least I had a chunk
Aight, okay, it's how I choose to live
Hehehe, awww

No more compromises
I see past your disguises
Blinding me through mind control
Stealing my eternal soul
Appealing through material
To keep me as your slave

But I get out, oh, I get out of all your boxes
I'll get out, oh, you can't hold me in these chains
I get out, oh, I want out of social bondage
Knowin' my condition, oh, is the reason I must change

Oh, and you ain't seen nothin' yet
Oh, I don't care if you're upset
I could care less if you're upset
See, it don't change the truth
And your hurt feeling's no excuse
To keep me in this box, psychological locks
Repressin' true expression
Cementin' this repression
Promotin' mass deception
So that no one can be healed

I won't protect your system
When you talk I don't listen
Oh, let my Father's will be done

And just get out, oh, just get out of all these bondage
Just get out, oh, you can't hold me in these chains
Just get out, all these traditions killin' freedom
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change

I've just accepted what you said
Keeping me among the dead
The only way to know is to walk to learn and grow
But faith is not your speed
Oh, you’d have everyone believe
That you're the sole authority
Just follow the majority
Afraid to face reality—the system is a joke
Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul
Oh, and escape this mind control
You spent your life in sacrifice to a system for the dead
Oh, are you sure, where is the passion in this living?
Are you sure it's God you serving?
Obligated to a system

Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll

On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan

When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that

Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha

Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?

As I look at what I've done
The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses blurred my sight

I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

I chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain)
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
See, torn and confused wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated
For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no I just should have heeded
Misled I bled 'till the poison was gone
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn

Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

Father you saved me and you showed me that life
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans
See, my soul was weary but now it's replenished
Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold I took back my soul
And totally let my creator control
The life which was his, the life which was his to begin with

Stress in the city, the cops is out for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth

Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'

Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'

Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby

With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world

With a broken heart first day can't help you

For my heart is not made of unbreakable material
While thinking about love its got to be mutual orelse someone is sure to be hurt

Tell me what would you do with it. oh~ Yeah~
Well I hope that you're sure
That what you say affects and not illusions
And you possess the right solutions
To be sure, we will get through
For so many before me have given their heart away completely
Without thinking over the matter deeply then realised when its too late
That love can bring joy but then again can be painful
For love ain't a game, you know it ain't a game... so

Garth Brooks,Country,Papa Loved Mama,Ropin’ the Wind,1992.0,"Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy bein' a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the bein' alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
When Daddy'd hang up she was gone again

Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama’s in the graveyard, Papa’s in the pen

Well it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for Mama up and down the hall
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town

Well the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes and he was shiftin' gears

Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined

We were just as wild as we were green, in the ways of the world
She picked me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night running all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove and the night
Was hot as a coal burning' stove
We were cooking the gas we were had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl was a mother to be for 2 weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
Life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

We took one more trip around the sun
It was all make believe in the end
No I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then
Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time; drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped

I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off

That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you

Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you
Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go
Remembering you
Fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you
How you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything

I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend, me and my bitch

Should they be someone with prosperity

That lives above the spiritual laws?

Lightly tinted, then send it to your block to have my full name
Cemented (Lauryn Hill!) And if your lines sound like mine
I'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!)
Unprecedented, and still respected
When it's finished, I'm serious, I'm takin over areas in Aquarius
Runnin red lights with my ten thousand chariots
Just as Christ was a Superstar, you're stupid, star!

Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Sellin' drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't livin' so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
'Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it

In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin', black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three

Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin' days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moët, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin' five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line

Listen, this is my evaluation
This shit oversaturated, y'all can get evacuated
Kids sippin' Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the Internet, stuck in place, salivatin'
Ain't nobody graduatin'
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn, I'm gettin' aggravated
Fuck, I'm gettin' agitated

The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on?
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fuckin' Matrix
It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest

How come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money
Why? When I can't take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
They gon' find out who you are
Just admit it 'fore you get admitted

Say, what you livin' about? (Fuck you gon' tell me?)
Do you remember where you started out though?
You're lookin' lost now (You want a pass? Oh, damn!)
Fake it 'til you make it, take your little paper
But when you look in the mirror your credibility’s gone now

In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off
Prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended
See how plain it was now, they want me to jet
But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off
Mistook me because I looked soft
But I stood tall, I just followed the (Doctor's orders)
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do, all's
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon
The drama setter, I'm going in, already got an arm and head in
Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em
I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch
And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse
It's worth it, so Doc turn the beat on
Whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind
In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog
And I'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
No signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign
Been a (Doctor's) assault rifle
With the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, I spray (uh)
Pain in the ass, you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waitin' on someone to say somethin'
Dre, make the bass pump!
And let the tape run for old time's sake!
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waitin' for has come, but the—

O what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry

Have we trials and temptations?

Baby, write this down, take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down
Take my words, read them every day, keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say, write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page, I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true, and I think you need to know

Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel where you'll see it for sure

Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

I wasn't born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
The flash flood, punk rock, and the alcohol
I was raised on a rerun
I was bored to death, so I started a band
Cut my teeth on a safety dance
My attention span never stood a chance

It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

You could never kill my high

I wasn't made for the good life
I ended up getting stuck on the side of the road
I tripped and fell on hard times
Tough breaks are the only kind I know
I was left on a door step
I was scared to death with nowhere to go
Cut myself on the neighbors' fence
That I hopped as the cops tried to take me in

It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

Pink Floyd,Rock,Dogs,Shine On,1977.0,"You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer


And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

(Stone, stone, stone...)

Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer


Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone

Willie Nelson,Country,Red Headed Stranger,Red Headed Stranger,1975.0,"The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And walking behind was a bay
The red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder
And his lips, they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait 'til tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life?
For this was the horse that his little lost darling
Had ridden when she was his wife

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

""Don't cross him, don't boss him
""He's wild in his sorrow
""He's riding and hiding his pain
""Don't fight him, don't spite him
""Just wait 'til tomorrow
""Maybe he'll ride on again""

The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free, of course
For you can't hang a man for killing a woman
Who's trying to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay

Holding you, I held everything
For a moment, wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey, who's to say, you know I might have changed it all

And now, I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain, but I'da had to miss
The dance

Yes, my life, it's better left to chance
I could have missed the pain, but I'da had to miss

Cutting and scratching are the aspects of his game
So check out the Master as he cuts these jams
And look at us with the mics in our hands
Then take a count, 1 2 3
Jam Master Jay, Run-D.M.C
He's Jam Master Jay, the big beat blaster
He gets better cause he knows he has to
In '84 he'll be a little faster
And only practice makes a real Jam Master
We're live as can be but we're not singing the blues
We got to tell all y'all the good news
The good news is that there is a crew
Not 5, not 4, not 3, just 2
2 MC's who are claiming the fame
And all other things won't be the same
Beacause it's about time for a brand new group
Run-D.M.C. to put you up on the scoop
We make the fly girls scream in ecstacy
We rock the freshest rhymes at a party
We put all the fellas in a daze
It's everyone that we amaze
And we got the master of a disco scratch
There's not a break that he can't catch
Jam Master Jay that is his name
And all wild DJ's he will tame
Behind the turntables is where he stands
Then there is the movement of his hands
So when asked who's the best, y'all should say:
""Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay""
Jam Master Jay is the one in charge
It's up to him to rock beats that are truly large
He is the master of the scratch and cut
So move your arms, so move your legs
So won't you move your butt
We're not talking ground, we're not talking sky
We're not talking low, we're not talking high
We're not talking big, we're not talking small
We want all of the people on off the wall
We're not talking night, we're not talking day
But we're talking bout Jam Master Jay",Sadness

Martina McBride,Country,Independence Day,The Way That I Am,1993.0,"Well she seemed all right by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So, I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day

Well, word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losin' end
Some folks whispered, some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
When time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today, is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay, it's Independence Day

Well she lit up the sky that fourth of July
By the time that the firemen come
They just put out the flames and took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now, I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today, is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay, it's Independence Day

Roll the stone away

A policeman knew my name
He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away""
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

And these tired bouncers would not let me in

Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin

And the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love
The girls, they wouldn't say HEY!

Hustlin my way in I'm on the guest list plus five!
Who's performin' tonight? He said Shabba
Mister Lover Daddy he be the selector

Drug money get converted into music
The dope man becomes an entertainer
Leave that crack alone! I told the customers

A thousand miles away
I came just for a little while
You know I never meant to stay
I meant to take my pleasure
Have a good time and be gone
But I fell in love with a lady
Now I sing a mountain song
I listened to the music
Of the night wind in the pines
I saw the quiet slendour
Of a field of columbine
I skied on crystal pathways
To a mountain peak so tall
And I walked the mighty summits
With the one who made it all
And I fell in love with a lady
'Cause I've seen her at her best
And I've walked her wild and rugged paths
Through her open wilderness
And now I never can betray her
Steal her riches and be gone
'Cause when you love a mountain lady
You're gonna sing a mountain song
Now people come from everywhere
To see what they can find
And some take lots of pictures
And some just take their time
But they're some who take her beauty
That can't be bought or sold
And they think of only money
While destroying wealth untold
But you fall in love with a lady
When you've slept upon her breast
And I've walked her wild and rugged paths
To her open wilderness
And you never can betray her
Steal her riches and be gone

You're gonna sing a mountain song",Tenderness

While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The son of God discloses

And he walks with me and he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet
The birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing


I'd stay in the garden with him
Though the night around me is falling
But He bids me go through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling",Tenderness

So they dreamt in vain
Once he spread the wheat
Had made garlands for his feet

Don't perceive his empty plea

Clawing adornment for his crimes

So they sent him far away

In their shapeless guilty remorse

Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died

And one must chose which side they join

Brotherman
Yeah
And meanwhile one man's meal
Is another man's poison
Mankind will do what they must to survive
Innit
Hear me now

In a gunman world
Any night him clock in at work
Marrow splatter, the toolbox pull
The magazine inna the two Glock full
And he's watching as the days go by
And he's counting as his peers all die
Sleeping with the rifle 'cross his chest
So he never gets a good night's rest
And then he's cranky in the morning times
And more victims have to lose their lives
The community a twist and twirl
Wishing that they wasn't in a gunman world
In a gunman life
He might not come home from work one night
So every minute matter
Ignores advice
From his weeping baby mother and child
That he won't win every game he plays
So she know he'll meet his end one day
Some juvenile will have to earn his stripe
And have to take another gunman's life
What if a backstabber names his price
And how ironic if him dead from knife
The 'mount of bullet weh him put 'pon boy
Job description: kill and destroy

Now tell me is it worth it all?

Back to school time come
'cuz when a gunman work
If he is successful
And the job is well done
Then there will be an unsolved crime
With no one to fill out all blank line
John Public haffi hear and deaf
Informer get a kuff, kaff, kweff
Does he get nervous just like you and I?
Watching out if the police pass by
'cuz any day you hear a gunman fail
Then it's either dead house or jail
What will it cost to make a gunman rich?
How many lives before a gunman switch?
The truth me want the youth them stop ignore
Say the majority of gunman poor, oya oh

Now tell me is it worth it all?

Tell me is it worth it all?
One child smile while a next one bawl
Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?

And when a gunman makes choice
I wonder what goes through a gunman's mind
And does a gunman think twice?
Before him takes another someone's life?
I wonder what it is a gunman say
To the Father when a gunman pray
Does he kiss his kids to bed at night?
Making sure the blanket tucked just right?
Nothing no scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no
Wha coulda scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no

Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it

You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

For your eyes, do you understand me?

It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you

One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you

Kenny Rogers,Country,Lucille,Kenny Rogers,1977.0,"In a bar in Toledo
Across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her
She said I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings
In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking
His big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

After he left us
I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talkin' at all
She was a beauty
But when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her
'Cuz the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

Pink Floyd,Rock,High Hopes,The Division Bell,1994.0,"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world filled with magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world


Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game
Oh yeah, get down heavy!


Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name

Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory
For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion
Conformin' our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Destortin' our tape recorders
From hearin' like under water
Beyond the borders
Find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
A systematic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate, worse than Sodom
What's got 'em, drunk off the spirits
Truth comes, we can't hear it
When you've been, programmed to fear it
I had a vision I was fallin' in indescision
Apallin', callin' religious
Some program on television
How can, dominant wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules
Intelligent fools
PhDs in illusion
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors in past delusion

The bloodshed of the male
Or confidence in the tale

Discussin' doctrines of Baal
Causin' people to fail
Keepin' the third in jail

Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoy darkness as Lord
Keepin' me from the sword
Block for mercy
Bitter than cerasee
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still, dined at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong, in true enemies defeat
Destitute in a necessity
Causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity, shapen in
There's no escapin' when
Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of a man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore
Achin' in sores
Babylon, the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance there can be no admission
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Saddam and Minister Farrakhan
What's goin' on, what's a priority to you
By what authority do to you
The majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters, check the verses
Recapture the land
Remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand

Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number 3: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number 4: I know you heard this before
""Never get high on your own supply""
Number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em ""bounce!""
Number 6: that goddamn credit? forget it
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
7: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8: never keep no weight on you!
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't tryna to listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number 10: a strong word called ""consignment""
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!""
Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, 24 years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half a cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up

Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you me heart
Don't want to take it back
And this is my chat (cho!)

Been searching for a long long time
For that oh-so-true love
To comfort this heart of mine
No pretense stop wasting my time
A virtuous woman is really hard to find
I'm telling you lady
I'm only human, not looking for impossibility
Just a genuine woman with sincerity
Someone who is always near to hold me
Show me you care, up front and boldly
Don't shun my feelings, all the positive meanings
Love me morning, noon all seasons

Wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
Nor what you want me to be
Could you love me for me?
Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you me heart
Don't want to take it back
This is my chat (cho)

Well every ho have it's stick in a bush
What happen to me...she must be somewhere out there
Now where could she be?
Caught up passionately in a love rhapsody
I'm like waiting on some honey
But there ain't no queen bee
Everybody's laughing
Some say I'm silly
No infatuation, no love fantasy
Woman you lead my life on a string
I can't tell the on and off thing
I'm oh so lonely inside so I sing

Wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
Nor what you want me to be
Could you love me for me?
Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you me heart
Don't want to take it back
This is my chat (cho)

I would spend my nights at home
But if it means contention
I'd rather be alone
Tell the service man cut the phones
Lock all communication
If there's no light within my day
I'd rather stay in isolation
For that special someone a lifetime I'll wait
I know that I'll be okay
Cross my heart, every day I live I pray
And I know she'll come my way
Night and day for this woman I pray

Wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
Nor what you want me to be
Could you love me for me?
Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you me heart
Don't want to take it back

You're the prettiest of flowers, girl me can't complain
When I'm with you I feel so high I rise above the rain
And you no do people damage, like that bitch cocaine, no
And leave them lonely, feeling only pain
Cause your DNA is of the highest strain
Your effect is so potent, it's so insane
You so gummy and sticky like a plasticine
When me grind out your body, only stems remain
And to love you is so risky, I might get detained
You always keep me flying on the highest plane
And anybody know, will always proclaim

No cross pollination, she's a real pure breed
Cultivated in love and she's not grown for greed
She's everything I want and also all I need

The Mission UK,Rock,Swan Song,The Brightest Light,,"At the crossing of the border between the night and day
Where the lost and lonely find their twilight sway
And the curse of their existence is the loneliness they feel
Where waking up with a stranger's the only thing from them that's real
So don't sing me your swan song, baby
There's life left in this ol' dog yet
It ain't over 'til it's over until the fat lady sings
It ain't over 'til it's over until the swan spreads
Her wings
And flies away
When you see the ache of lovers as they fumble
In the night
And you feel the wrench inside you as any ex lover might
You can say your time is over for love and all the heat
But a single stranger's kiss can always turn
The bitter into sweet
So don´t sing me your swan song, baby
There's still gas left in this tank
It ain't over 'til it's over until the fat lady sings
It ain't over 'til it's over until the swan spreads
Her wings
And flies away

You're beautiful

Although I hurt, I must be strong
Because inside, I know

Now look at you now big, but I worry about you
I worry about you all the time, hangin' out on the corner
All times at night with the cruel people
Baby, that ain't nothin' but trouble
I always taught you that you could have whatever you dream
Well, I want you to hold on to that dream, baby
Hold on to it real tight, ‘cause the sky's the limit

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doing tonight?
I'd like to welcome to the stage

I like this young man, because when he came out
He came out with the phrase
He went from ashy to classy – I like that
So everybody in the house
Give a warm round of applause for The Notorious B.I.G
The Notorious B.I.G
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for him y'all!

Uh, a nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young, I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pin stripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You want to see the inside? I see you later
Here comes the drama, oh
That's that nigga with the fake, blaow
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in your place
Play your position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew or they might be next
Look at their man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with them, stole with them
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, butter crunch

I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of them
Long as I got stuff from most of them
It's on, even when I was wrong, I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fucking, bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stacking, dabbled in crack, gun packing
Nickname Medina make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class to Inglés pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Getting larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no telling where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers
Praying God forgive us for being sinners, help us out

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want

After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have to be in school by ten
I then began to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart
Break it down into sections, drugs by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missing
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustlers Prayer:
""If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand""
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase ""Sky's the limit""
Motherfuckers, see you chumps on top

Just keep on pressing on

Got up with the scent of a woman
So picture if you would what life would be
... ain't much good without a woman
She can nag and be a constant pain
Oh, that woman
But those hips
She's got me whipped
And it's just too hard to resist
What a woman

She'll put a smile upon your face
And take you to a higher place
So don't you underestimate
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman
Tender lips that's so so sweet
Gentle words she softly speaks
Such an angel when we meet
God bless the ground beneath her feet
She can take you on a high
Be your comfort when you cry
But if you look into her eyes you'll see
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman

She'll put a smile upon your face

Been putting up a real good fight
There were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

Garth Brooks,Country,If Tomorrow Never Comes,Garth Brooks,1989.0,"Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart?

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

'Cause if tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last

Word life, I get that ass robbed on spite
Check the method from Bedrock 'cause I rock your head to bed
Just like rockin' what? Twin Glocks!
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, goin' to war right now
So, yo, bombin', We Usually Take All Niggas Garments
Save your breath before I vomit

I'm on the trigger, plus I got the Wu-Tang sword
So how you figure that you can even fuck with mine?
Hey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time!
And pull a foul, niggas, save the beef for the cow
I'm milkin' this ho, this is my show, Tical

Armed and geared, 'cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system for murderin' the rhythm
Now lo and behold another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin' charge when I explode

Slammin' a hype-ass verse 'til your head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fast and quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox
I'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashbacks how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw, I repeat
If I die, my seed'll be ill like me
Approachin' me, yo, out of respect, chops to neck
I get vexed, like crashin' up a phat-ass Lex
So, clear the way! Make way! Yo, open the cage!
Peace, I'm out, jettin' like a runaway slave

You gettin' stripped from your garments, boy, run your jewels
All the meth got me open like fallopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through your navel
Suspenseful force bein' brought through my utensil
The pencil, I bring strong winds up against you
Havoc, then run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics

A-a-a-ah-ah, are you a warrior killer slicin' shit like a samurai?
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin' at your ass like a sorceress, shootin' that piss
Niggas be gettin' on my fuckin' nerves
Rhymes they be kickin'
Make me wanna kick their fuckin' ass to the curb
Boy got funky fresh like the Old Specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, Unique drop that science

My- My- My- My clan is thick like plaster, bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master
Killer, style jumped off in Killa Hilla
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manila

If hospitals cure
Then prisons must bring their pain

There is never redemption
Any fool can regret yesterday
Nail it to the House of Lords
You will be buried in the same box as a killer
As a killer

A drained white body hangs from the gallows
Is more righteous than Hindley's crotchet lectures
Pain not penance, forget martyrs, remember victims

A bloody vessel for your peace
If man makes death then death makes man
Tear the torso with horses and chains

And your nowhere near

Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes, in walked the man

Like you was gonna do somethin'
Actin' like you catchin' bodies (Ayy!)
And you got juice, lil' youngin', you buggin'
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged into nothin'
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (Pew!)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a

Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling you motherfuckers
But just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories
Jarred like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock demi-god
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting—through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artille—ry, Godzilla, harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off
And you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'll be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I blow 80 holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and
I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
I double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical—but not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster!

With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me ‘cause I can finally afford
To provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio
And it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales weren't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped

With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani

I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge

With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches

And in these plagued streets of pity you can buy anything
For 200 anyone can conceive a God on video
He's a boy, you want a girl so tear off his cock
Tie his hair in bunches, fuck him, call him Rita if you want

I eat and I dress and I wash and I can still  say thank you
Puking - shaking - sinking I still stand for old ladies
Can't shout, can't scream, hurt myself to get pain out

I 'T' them, 24:7, all year long
Purgatory's circle, drowning here, someone will always say yes
Funny place for the social, for the insects to start caring
Just an ambulance at the bottom of a cliff

And in these plagued streets of pity you can buy anything
For 200 anyone can conceive a God on video
He's a boy, you want a girl so tear off his cock
Tie his hair in bunches, fuck him, call him Rita if you want

I eat and I dress and I wash and I can still  say thank you
Puking - shaking - sinking I still stand for old ladies
Can't shout, can't scream, hurt myself to get pain out
Power produces desire, the weak have none
There's no lust in this coma even for a fifty
Solitude, solitude, the 11th commandment

The only certain thing that is left about me
There is no part of my body that has not been used
Pity or pain, to show displeasure's shame
Everyone I've loved or hated always seems to leave

And in these plagued streets of pity you can buy anything
For 200 anyone can conceive a God on video
He's a boy, you want a girl so tear off his cock
Tie his hair in bunches, fuck him, call him Rita if you want

Power produces desire, the weak have none
There's no lust in this coma even for a fifty
Solitude, solitude, the 11th commandment
Don't hurt, just obey, lie down, do as they say
May as well be heaven this hell, smells the same
These sunless afternoons I can't find myself

Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate

Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here, boy, I wanna dance!""

And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

I eat it up and take the cake
I just avert my eyes to the pain
Of someone's loss helping my gain

You'd be plugging in the wrong socket

Touch my heart and feel winter

Can see through to the other side
Your cities are made of wood
Antiques are what you've got inside
Houses are paper but folks don't hear a word you say
Friendship's like acid
It burns, burns, burns as it slides away

With this synthetic world we're livin' in
The word imitation is goin' cross the nation
What's real has become a freak
Someone's tryin' to make me weak
Strange initials to keep me blind
Psychedelic music to blow my mind

Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger, ever near me
And the sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious, sacred scenes unfold
Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear
In the stillness of the midnight
Echoes from the past I hear
Old-time singing, gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere
I remember mother praying
Father, too, on bended knee
Sun is sinking, shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me
As I travel on life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hope grows fonder

The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
Of silent desperation never speaking to a soul

Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain

Of the clicking of the turnstyle and the rattle of his chain

Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
See she said, I put on new stockings just to please you

For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home
Standing in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by
And he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
Oh she said, I suppose you seldom think about me

If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah!)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50!)

Destination heaven
Sit and politic with passengers from 9/11
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines
Knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends
They know how to pretend

Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm

They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy
Let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit
They ain't sayin' shit — spray 'em, 50!
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi
And just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'?
You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot

See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50 — man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

Niggas shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you makin' a mistake, I'll split ya
Leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets
With all them zippers

The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey

For the drop of the name, the parties, the pills

Has gone another round
As I lay there alone on this big empty bed
With nothing but thoughts of you in my head
I think of the things that I wish I had said
When you were still around

When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be

The sum of all my fears and all my doubts

A message to God

Since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us, so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow
Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go

If you wan' know why (Why I live my life)
The way that I do (Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (Cause I know my way around)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper

You's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
I'm anxious to believing real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you

Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see
The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 508
I saw God today

I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down and stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I Saw God Today

Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But I noticed that she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splashing down from mounting in shades of red


Got my face pushed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her Mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle

Do you remember a time when fear
In the days when I was stronger
In the days when you were here
She said when days had no beginning
While days had no end
When shadows grew no longer
I knew no other friend but you
Were wild
You were wild.....
Frost upon these cigarettes
Lipstick on the window pane

Through the rain
Trying to hold on
Waiting for the train

It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this.""
Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.""

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time

I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now – wait, here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!

Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend

Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged

I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark

And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long

De La Soul,Hip-Hop,The Magic Number,3 Feet High and Rising,1989.0,"Three, that’s the Magic Number
Yes, it is, it’s the magic number
Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community
Was born three: Mase, Dove and me
And that’s the magic number
(What does it all mean?)

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos’ pleasure
Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart
Something that stimulates the music in my measure
Measure in my music, raised in three parts
Casually see but don’t do like the Soul
Cause seein’ and doin’ are actions for monkeys
Doin’ hip hop hustle, no rock and roll
Unless your name’s Brewster, cause Brewster's a Punk (three)
Parents let go cause there’s magic in the air
Criticising rap shows you're out of order
Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires
And don’t get offended while Mase do-si-do’s your daughter
A tri-camera rolls since our music’s now set
Fly rhymes are stored on a Da.I.S.Y. production
It stands for “Da Inner Sound, Y’all” and y’all can bet
That the action's not a trick, but showing the function

Everybody wants to be a deejay
Everybody wants to be an emcee
But being speakers are the best
And you don’t have to guess
De La Soul posse consists of three
And that’s the magic number

This here piece of the pie
Is not dessert, but the course that we dine
And three out of every darn time
The effect is “Mmmm” when a daisy grows in your mind
Showing true position, this here piece is
Kissin’ the part of the pie that's missin’
When that negative number fills up the cavity
Maybe you can subtract it
You can call it your lucky partner
Maybe you can call it your adjective
But odd as it may be
Without my 1 and 2 where would there be
My three: Mase, Pos and me
And that’s the Magic Number
Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds
Common are speakers who honor the scroll
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound
Listeners listen cause this here is wisdom
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug
Set aside a legal substance to feed ‘em
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug
Time is a factor so it's time that counts
Count not the negative actions of one
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout
Three forms the soul to a positive sum
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle
Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle
Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number
Now you may try to subtract it
But it just won't go away
Three times one?
(What is it?)
(One, two, three!)
And that's a Magic Number
(Yo, what's up?)
(1, 2, 3)
(I say, children, what does it all mean?)

Drake,Hip-Hop,From Time,Nothing Was the Same,2013.0,"What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose

Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'

I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now

I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em

Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules

Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off

Would I still find you

Following behind you

Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow

If I were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color blouse
And your soft shoe shining?

Miranda Lambert,Country,Things That Break,The Weight of These Wings,2016.0,"I was born a bull in a china cabinet
Drawn to the delicate like it's a magnet
Perfume bottles on a mirror tray
Tempered glass on a window pane
Timeless face on a pocket watch
Time is ticking

I leave it all in ruins
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break

Can't make a man a promise
With the best of intentions
Drive two hundred miles on a rundown engine
Put a blanket underneath a hollow tree
When the wind blows hard it will fall on me
Stick around long enough and you will see
Time is ticking

I leave it all in ruins
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break

Me, I don't ever wanna get too close
Or be held responsible
For all the pain that you can't see
Somebody once broke me

I leave it all in ruins

Glittering gown
And his golden beard flows

And nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note
In my symphony

And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)

Do you remember the taste?
Remember family names

How could I forget?
A ballad was born upon a demo of a fly love song
Didn't take long before the archer with the wings heard it
Shot us in the heart with a contract, he knew we were a hit
The right amount of soul with a parallel amount of grit
But the archer couldn't see the target of departure
Gave in your pink slip and called it quits
It's understood you would
Label me the mate who wronged you
Cause I kept wanting to feature
With them other females on they songs too
Your words spoken in mono for monogamy
Telling me I had to go cause I chose
Stereo for stereotypical male biology
And now I'm left setting traps
For you to fall in for me again
Who hates you to tell me
""Slow up the pace, maybe erase, don't…""

Slow up the pace
Maybe erase, don't remember my waist

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place

I love the memory of...

Our last trip to Vegas had me feeling like we had a chance
But chance just showed up at the wedding
I guess I didn't read the heading
""Forgivin' won't erase the bitter past""
But I ain't up for kissing ass
I bought you everything your pretty feet could fit in
Put you behind the finest steering wheels
Fearing you would drive a nigga crazy
Told you grow up, but shit, you was my baby
Bits and pieces never made nothing decent
When I accommodated you, you played me like a stranger

I remember you now (Accountability is major)
A part of what I did then
Remember your face
Just don't let me trip over memory lane
Cause time can't be replaced
And I don't want to stay

Cause, oh, it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's so dah-dah-dee-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah
It's so easy to fall
In dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah

Zion

Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
""Look at your career,"" they said
""Lauryn, baby use your head""
But instead I chose to use my heart

Is in Zion! (Zion, Zion!)

Is in Zion! (Zion, uhh, Zion!)

Than to wait at Zion's door

Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you, my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

Willingness to do everything for that person

Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

The way they act

Uh-huh

The way they carry themselves, stuff like that

Okay

The way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. It's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. It's like, that way, you know?

Yeah

It's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something

That's deep

That's what I'm talking about

I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that?

It's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. They can't love you. 'Cause love-love-love wouldn't do that

And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then

And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him

Johnny Cash,Country,The Man Comes Around,American IV: The Man Comes Around,2002.0,"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying, ""Come and see."" And I saw, and behold a white horse

There's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

Till Armageddon no salam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundred weight and penny pound
When the man comes around

And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts. And I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and hell followed with him",Sadness

Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps - repeat my own and reflect my thoughts
Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrapers and this morning's papers
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow - they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change - and pull out the Queen
Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows - gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
""Hey boy"" they shout ""have you got any money?""
And I said ""I've a little money and a take away curry
I'm on my way home to my wife
She'll be lining up the cutlery
You know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork""

I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and Wormwood Scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth
It blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight
The last thing that I saw
As I lay there on the floor
Was ""Jesus Saves"" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British Rail poster read ""Have an Awayday - a cheap holiday - Do it today!""
I glanced back on my life
And thought about my wife
Cause they took the keys - and she'll think it's me

Lucky Dube,Reggae,Victims,Victims,,"Didn, t know she was crying
Until now as she turns to look at me
She said boy o' boy you bring tears to my eyes
I said what, she said
Boy o' boy you bring tears to my eyes
Bob Marley said
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
But little did he know that
Eventually the enemy
Will stand aside and look
While we slash and kill
Our own brothers
Knowing that already
They are the victims of the situation
Still licking wounds from brutality
Still licking wounds from humiliation
She said all these words and the
Wrinkles on her face became
Perfect trails for the tears and she said;
Chorus: (x3)
We are the victims everytime
We got double trouble everytime
She took me outside to the churchyard
Showed me graves on the ground
And she said;
There lies a man who fought for equality
There lies a boy who died in his struggle
Can all these heroes die in vain
While we slash and kill our own brothers
Knowing that already they are the
Victims of the situation
Still licking wounds from brutality
Still licking wounds from humiliation

Want to laugh 'bout how I got my ass
Caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us kissin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do

I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas ‘cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through

Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia

I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?
What make that even more fucked up

Showed me how to laugh and how to cry
It introduced me to some friends of mine
And brightened up some days
It helped me make it through some lonely nights
Oh, what a friend to have on a cold lonely night

This old guitar gave me my lovely lady
It opened up her eyes and ears to me
It brought us close together
I guess it broke her heart
But it opened up the space for us to be
What a lovely place, a lovely space to be

This old guitar gave me my life, my living
All the things you know I love to do
To serenade the stars that shine
From a sunny mountain side
Most of all, to sing my songs for you
Ooh, I love to sing my songs for you

Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong

Said, ""I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride isn't home tonight
Since you've been gone she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth""
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, ""Boy, don't you lose your head
Because to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself""

Walking on home because he didn't live far - you see
Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found the only thing
Daddy had left him and that was a gun

He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
A big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
""Why'd you do it?""

Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said supper's waiting at home and I got to get to it

It's so hard to comprehend
Why you set up your dreams to have them smashed in the end
But you don't mind you've got time on your side
And they're never gonna make you stand in line
You're just waiting for the right time
You're fearless and brave - you can't be stopped when you're young
You swear you're never ever gonna work for someone
No corporations for the new age sons
Tears of rage roll down your face
But still you say ""it's fun""
And you find out life isn't like that

Why the world is your oyster but your future's a clam
It's got you in its grip before you're born
It's done with the use of a dice and a board

You used to fall in love with everyone

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile

I'm a little more sitting up high on the road than a little car
I'm a little more bust ya back than take it for free
And that’s how I'll always be
I'm a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
I'm a little more ol' Hank Williams than that trendy crap
I love a flat wood ol' front porch made of an old oak tree
And that's how I'll always be

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

I got friends that say I live a little like Cool Hand Luke
Fast cars and motorcycles, raisin' hell in cowboy boots
But, hey, on Sunday morning, I'll take the back row seat
That's how I'll always be

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

I'm a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender
That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her
Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin' down
Handshake deals, fresh-cut hay fields, and hometowns

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'

Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise

And these broken dreams and plans that didn't last
I'll trade them for a future, I can't use them anymore
I've wasted love, but I still have some more

Gone are the lavat'ries in the back yard
Gone are the days when you dreamed of that car
You just want to sit in your Shangri-La

Put on your slippers and sit by the fire
You've reached your top, and you just can't get any higher
You're in your place, and you know where you are
In your Shangri-La

And all the houses in the street have got a name
Cause all the houses in the street, they look the same
Same chimney puff, same little car, same window panes
The neighbors call to tell you things that you should know
They say their lines, they drink their tea, and then they go
They tell your business in another Shangri-La
The gas bills and the water rates, the payments on the car
Too scared to think about how insecure you are
Life ain't so happy in your little Shangri-La!

Oh, Shangri-La, Shangri-La

Pull it into park and lay it on the grass
I roll back the ride, so I can see some ass
Clock one sista, fifteens in the rear
Bump a forty, leaves me gawkin' here

I jump back in the wagon, lock up the ass
Pop in the tape and a match
West when I fly I take the exit on Crenshaw
And guess what I saw
Two fools at the light, they stared me up
But I just look 'em in the eye and I say, ""Wassup?""
And even though I really don't want no trouble
I got thirty-one replies to bust your bubble
I don't really wanna hurt nobody
So I keeps on rollin' on my way to the party
I just wanna kick it, yeah, that's the ticket
Pass me the cup so we can get twisted


I'm rollin with my homies, yeah...
'Said we'd yak all night, yeah yeah...
I roll up to the party and I'm straight old bent
And 'catchin' me a freak was my intent
There's a whole pack o' rats' ass standin' in the front
So I drops the ass and let the sistas bump
Here comes one now, she's on the tip
She says she likes the way my woofers kick
But I don't fall in love with every girl I see
So I pass up two and go straight to three
She got a ass like the back of a bus, cuz
And that's why I say ""In Crips We Trust""
I let her hit my twenty, got straight to the point
Wassup? Do you wanna kick it or what?
I ain't got time to be frontin', I ain't talkin' 'bout nuttin' Just a little sumpin' sumpin'

You try to plant somethin in the conrete, y'knowhatImean?
If it GROW, and the and the rose petal got all kind of
Scratches and marks, you not gon' say, ""Damn, look at
All the scratches and marks on the rose that grew from concrete""
You gon' be like, ""Damn! A rose grew from the concrete?!""
Same thing with me, y'knahmean? I grew out of all of this
Instead of sayin, ""Damn, he did this, he did this,""
Just be like, ""DAMN! He grew out of that? He came out of that?""
That's what they should say, y'knowhatImean?
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty
Y'knowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me
I'm just tryin to make somethin..

When no one even cared
The rose it grew from concrete
Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet
It came from concrete

Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
Funny it seems but, by keepin its dreams
It, learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else even cared
No one else even cared..
The rose that grew from concrete

Did you hear..
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned to walk without having feet
Funny it seems but by keeping its dreams
It learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else, even cared

Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet (to breathe the fresh air)
It came from concrete (to breathe the fresh air)
(to breathe the fresh air, to breathe the fresh air)

You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
Had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its
Tenacity. We would all love it's will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses - this is the concrete - and these are
My damaged petals. Don't ask me why, thank God nigga, ask me how!

You have to go to task in the city

Is only just light years to go

Me, my thoughts are flower strewn
Ocean storm, bayberry moon

Watch the road and memorize
This life that passed before my eyes
And nothing is going my way

The ocean is the river's goal
A need to leave the water knows
We're closer now than light years to go

I have got to find the river

Run through my head and fall away
Leave the road and memorize
This life that passed before my eyes
And nothing is going my way

There's no one left to take the lead
But I tell you and you can see
We're closer now than light years to go

The river empties to the tide
Fall into the ocean

The river to the ocean goes
A fortune for the undertow
None of this is going my way
There is nothing left to throw
Of Ginger, lemon, indigo
Coriander stem and rose of hay

The privileged and weary eyes
Of river poet search naiveté

The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk

Because his heart is made of knotty pine

Is it any wonder, that his face is red?

Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian never went nowhere
His heart was set on the Indian maiden with the coal black hair

Just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer ""yes"" or ""no""
And then one day, a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
And took her, oh, so far away but old Kaw-Liga stayed

Kaw-Liga
Just stands there as lonely as can be
And wishes he was still an old pine tree

The idea was simple for a decent overloading
And for a multiple flash with no cords attached

It's connected to an accessory to his hip
Which automatically fires in perfect synchro
But perhaps his most exciting development is his angle
They call it the Dance
It's the St. Vitus Dance
Such flexibility
What an accessory
See his soft bounce
What flexibility
Such a soft bounce
What an accessory
Ah
And for special effects he has six filters
Three coloured red with the others pilfered
And if you really want to know what that means
He could throw a blue flash from eighty-five feet

So we devised a few simple and easy-to-crack contortions
So you can bump and scrape all the day through

Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes the business end of this shit
Can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still with you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you
And that's just being real with you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they
(Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name outta your mouth
And we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference!

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute, I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now
While this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back
(Right) Just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one,
Nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed:
""Whose throat is it?""
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch
I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream ""I just don't give a fuck"" and see who means it

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do

And kiss the snake goodnight

Pretty noose is pretty hate
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

Let your motor race

Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S

Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want

Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it

To put it all down the drain

Hoping that you'll make me stay

Ever changin' as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores

And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

Too many times we stand aside
And let the waters slip away
Till what we put off till tomorrow
Has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance the tide

Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

And there's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll take some falls
But with the good Lord as my captain

Loretta Lynn,Country,Coal Miner’s Daughter,Coal Miner’s Daughter,1970.0,"Well I was born the coal miner's daughter
In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor but we had love
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar
My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mine
All day long in the field hauling corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard everyday
Why I've seen her fingers bleed, to complain there was no need
She's smiled in mommy's understanding way
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog, money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler
Well a lot of things have changed since the way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor nothing lives here anymore
Except the memories of a coal miner's daughter",Tenderness

And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

Rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley
Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster
At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the MAC will

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again",Tension

And the gasoline car is gone
When an airplane flies without any fuel
And sunlight heats our home
One of these days when the air clears up

Eating rainbow stew with a silver spoon
Underneath that sky of blue
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up

Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust

Just be proud of what makes you country

Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on

Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?

(Ey, homie, what happened)
My whole life flashed before my eyes, man

Life...
Niggas used to come and get me
When it was time to disagree with an enemy
Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at, I'll clear the whole pack
Talking shit cause I'm down for my set
I'm a vet, smoking on a wet cigarette
Who these niggas think they are
Wishing on a ghetto star, I represent my tar
I start busting and they scatter like water bugs
Cause these Westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors
Cause sometimes I feel like a nut
Don’t give a fuck when I open you up
Hot rocks
Fly from the back seat
And busta-ass niggas run like a track meet
And if you caught in the middle
Bleed more than a little (what)
Killer King is the hospital
Feeling numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit
Black mothers have fits
I don’t give a shit

Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
It's raining bullets and I'm still there
I'm still there

My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning taking out the trash
Feeling like a loser, alcohol abuser
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
One on the peddles, the other on the handle bars
Tryna be ghetto stars
They said, ""are you from the Westside is it so?""
I said, ""hell yeah and who want to know?""

In slow mo’, .44 slugs, face down in the mud
Puddle full of blood
Left for dead, the pain starts to spread
Now I can’t feel my legs
I meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center
As I enter I.C.U
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can’t move my legs, he said don’t try to
Now this ain’t the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again
I sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night I jerk and jerk
But my dick don’t work it don’t even hurt
Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube
A'be pissing through a tube

Fuck a V-A they need G-A

Now I'm drinking Ripple
Same corner, same hood I'm still there
With bandanas tied to my wheel chair
To all the hood rat hoes I'm fired
They mad cause my tongue get tired
Now everybody want to put they dope on me
Sayin I won't get searched by the LAPD
I'm sittin' in a doorway deuce-five
Depending on that to keep my ass alive
I don’t got bows but my arm's about a one-six
With fucking legs looking like tooth picks
Some times I can’t deal
Got to beg the BG's to roll me up the hill
Put me on the porch
Now I'm on the torch
Smoking cocaine
Just to maintain
Nothing to gain nothing to lose
And last night I couldn’t make it to the bathroom
Feeling like a 2-year-old
You can’t get a sip from the brew I hold
It’s the only friend to a stranger
AKA: handicapped gangbanger
There's a lot in my life I regret becoming a ghetto vet
Fool I'm a Vet

Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
It's raining bullets and I'm still there
I'm still there
Dedicated to all the ghetto vets

Johnny Cash,Country,I Hung My Head,American IV: The Man Comes Around,2002.0,"Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead

I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head and my hands
The sheriff, he asked me
""Why had I run?""
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead

I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find""
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead

I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy
For soon I'll be dead

Dr. Dre,Hip-Hop,I Need a Doctor,,2011.0,"I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
‘Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ‘em
They just say it's wack — but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It’s dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
‘Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick; you
Gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic, or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do
‘Cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle; you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, ‘cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain't givin' up on me — get up, Dre!
I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake! ‘Cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags, and as
I’m leavin', I’ll guarantee they'll scream:
""Dre, don’t leave us like that, man!"" ‘cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time

It takes money to pay your rent and to eat
Without money your home be on the street
So you steal some money and got to jail, uhh
And then you turn around and need sumtin for bail
When you need twenty cents to call your lawyer
To plead innocence and say they never saw ya
But before ya ya lawyer a-get you free
He asks how will you pay his fee?
But you have no money, you're in a jam
Your lawyer don't give a damn, watch the cell doors slam

Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me

And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that?
Or do I ever cross your mind?

Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, tell me darling
Or do I ever cross your mind

Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close

Coolio,Hip-Hop,Mary Jane (I’m in Love With),Half-Baked (Music From The Motion Picture),,"She's my inspiration
My part time occupation
The catalyst and my consumation
In my quest for education
No one could ever take her place and
No assimilation, so save you false accusations
I accept no imitations
So that's the situation without further hesitation
Let me continue my demonstration
For the congregation
To break it down for all y'all simple and plain
I got a love for a girl named mary jane
Chorus:
Whatcha know about mary jane?
How ya'll feel about mary jane
Ya'll don't know about mary jane
'cause she's my main thing
Whatcha know about mary jane?
How ya'll feel about mary jane
Ya'll don't know about mary jane
She makes my heart sing
As i walk around the edges of my mind
In an attempt to contemplate
What it really is that makes me tick
I'm reminded of emotions that saturate
My thoughts like sunshine
It always ain't the first time
That i'm feelin' this, feelin that
I'm feelin' that
They don't know about my baby
And the healing power
It makes a strong man stronger
And a crazy man sing
I'm talkin about mary jane
Mary's potent, see, yes it opens me
And makes me see things in a way
I'd never thought i'd see
Mary ease pain
And mary never complains
Mary jane penetrates the brain
Y'know what i'm sayin'
Chorus
I'm not the first
And i probably won't be the last
I ain't mad at mary 'cause
Mary always makes me laugh
Mary brings light to the darkness
Let me spark one up quickly
Before they come and get me
Don't listen to what they say 'cause
Mary never contrary
Mary mary very
Nececessary extraordinary
Me and mary to the mortuary
Just one kiss on her sweet lips
And i become a visionary
Mary never the same
Mary don't change
Mary make a man walk a mile in the rain
Mary mary never temporary
She's my sanctuary
And when the love comes down
I'm the beneficiary
Some say if it's this good
Then it must be wrong
But mary makes me feel so good
'cause mary lasts so long
Mary mary got no secondary
Sweeter than a cherry
Blackberry, or a strawberry
Without mary, life ain't complete
'cause mary don't lie, mary don't steal
And mary don't cheat
Let me break it down for all y'all
Simple and plain
I've got a love for a girl named mary jane
Chorus
I'm in love with with mary jane
I'm not the only one
Mary likes to play around
I let her have her fun
She's not the kind of girl
That you can just tie down
Mary likes to spread her love
And turn my head around
I'm in love with mary jane
She's my main thing
She makes me feel alright
Makes my heart sing
And when i'm feelin' low
It comes as no surprise
Turns me on with her love
Takes me to paradise
Do you love me, mary jane?

Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
Cause my crew is rollin hummers and your crew is rollin dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryin to preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there

More temptation than faith, I guess we livin for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught slippin when they come and do all the gettin
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta later start
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'mma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there waitin with the sounds bumpin


You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryina stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if you're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side


As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me

I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‘Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me

I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?

We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets

Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons, see how I come and bring out the betterness?

She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows

As the storm blows on out of control

She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, ""He won't do this again""

George Strait,Country,Check Yes Or No,Strait Out Of The Box,1995.0,"It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell

Next day I chased her 'round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote

""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room

Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time, a story on the radio

Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer for something better
Please love me
Meet my mother, but the fear takes hold
Creeping up the stairs in the dark
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow

Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything?,
She struggles to get away
The pain and the creeping feeling, a little black haired girl
Waiting for Saturday, the death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me and turn me 'round
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days

Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All shadows and deliverance under a black flag
A hundred years of blood, crimson
The ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth and my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water
Thrashing in the water
Over and over, we die one after the other
Over and over, we die one after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other

Miranda Lambert,Country,Runnin’ Just in Case,The Weight of These Wings,2016.0,"There's trouble where I'm going
But I'm gonna go there anyway
I hate Sunday mornings
Cause they always seem to start this way
I'm looking for a lighter
I already bought the cigarettes
Guess I picked me up a habit
On my way out of Lafayette
Eastbound and Down
I turn it up 'cause that's sure how I feel
My mind is racing through the pines
My hands are shaky on the steering wheel
I'm going north on 59 but I know good and well
I'm headed south
'Cause me and Birmingham
Don't have a history of working out

What I lost in Louisiana
I found back in Alabama
But nobody ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm running just in case

I ain't unpacked my suitcase
Since the day that I turned twenty one
It's been a long ten years since then
It's getting kinda cumbersome
The first one and the last one
And the one that's got my name in ink
The smoker and the fighter
And the one in every song I sing

What I lost in Lubbock, Texas
I looked for in all the rest
But I guess no one ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm running just in case

I carry them around with me
I don't mind having scars
Happiness ain't prison
But there's freedom in a broken heart",Sadness

Get triple times the money and spendin' it like they wanna

They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9
See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line

You don't know whether or not to lay low

Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose

The bus ride, I went to write this, 4:00 a.m, this letter
Fields of poppies, little pearls all the boys and all the girls
Sweet-toothed, each and every one a little scary
I said your name, I wore it like a badge of teenage film stars
Hash bars, cherry mash and tinfoil tiaras
Dreaming of Maria Callas, whoever she is

Maybelline eyes and girl-as-boy moves

Adrenaline, it pulls us near

I'll take you over

Will you live to 83? Will you ever welcome me?
Will you show me something that nobody else has seen?
Smoke it, drink, here comes the flood, anything to thin the blood
These corrosives do their magic slowly and sweet
Phone, eat it, drink, just another chink
Cuts and dents, they catch the light
Aluminum, the weakest link
I don't want to disappoint you, I'm not here to anoint you
I would lick your feet, but is that the sickest move?
I wear my own crown of sadness and sorrow
And who'd have thought tomorrow would be so strange?

Cherry-flavored neck and collar

The sweat, the victory and sorrow, the smell of fear

And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes

Then your first thought is to start second guessin'

And a little girl named Corin

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up

Love does lie
No matter where I go I will come back to my English Rose
For nothing can ever tempt me from she
I've searched the secret mists -
I've climbed the highest peaks
Caught the wild wind home
To hear her soft voice speak
No matter where I roam
I will return to my English Rose
For no bonds can ever keep me from she
I've been to ancient worlds

Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come

Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears

Lord, lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered many years
And shed so many tears

Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change… and that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
""I gotta get paid!"" — well hey, but that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
(You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

Some things'll never change",Sadness
Kenny Rogers,Country,The Gambler,The Gambler,1978.0,"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

I need you more and more
Through the years, through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had, I've always been so glad

It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away

Through the years, when everything went wrong

We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucka with the gangsta beats
And we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do
Sucking on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothing
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doing ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's taking me to court

We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm

Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes

She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it

Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up

We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, up straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires, the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

There were people standing all around
Something warm running in my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me darling just a little while.""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night

Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

You the difference in Iraq and Iran

Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

2Pac,Hip-Hop,Dear Mama,Me Against the World,1995.0,"You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)

And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, with the
River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh",Tenderness
Run-D.M.C.,Hip-Hop,King of Rock,King of Rock,1985.0,"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MCs should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect
They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devastating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul
Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a verbal treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?
Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school
You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band
Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC
I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send
Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean
Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can jaw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these
PERIOD!",Sadness
The Beatles,Rock,Yesterday,Help!,1965.0,"Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday",Sadness
The Sundays,Rock,Love,Blind,1992.0,"Picture myself as a thin white child
Back to the day I was born on
They slapped me into line as it crossed my mind
I've felt better
I've felt worse
This is my life and it's all very well
But never never never again, oh
As they say ""We've been robbed""
And don't you know that this time
Love, just love yourself like no one else
Love, it's enough
They can say what they like but they still can't take that
Distance myself from the things I'd like but
Everyone has something I need
Don't let me wake up & find
All those others leaving me behind
If you don't have a clue about life
Then I'm happy to say
Neither have I although
I'm not going to shrug my shoulders & suck my thumb
This time
Cos there's something I deserve
Love, just love yourself like no one else
Love, it's enough
They can say what they like but they still can't take that
Picture my house in a postcard town
Picture a bomb in the sky
History at your door
Who could ask for more?
I've felt better
So kill me with love
Just love yourself like no one else
Love, it's enough
They can say what they like but they still can't take that
Time's so scarce where I come from
Let them say what they like
Cos they still can't take your love",Tenderness
The Cure,Rock,Killing an Arab,Boys Don’t Cry,1978.0,"Standing on the beach
With a gun in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel
At the arab on the ground
I can see his open mouth
But I hear no sound

I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab

I can turn
And walk away
Or I can fire the gun
Staring at the sky
Staring at the sun
Whichever I chose
It amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing


I feel the steel butt jump
Smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring at myself
Reflected in the eyes
Of the dead man on the beach

Garth Brooks,Country,Mom,Man Against Machine,2014.0,"A little baby told God
Hey I'm kinda scared, don't really know if
I wanna go down there
Because from here it looks like a little blue ball
But that's a great big place and I'm so small
Why can't I just stay here with you?
Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too?'
And God said, 'Oh child, of course I do
But there's somebody special that's waiting for you'
So hush now baby don’t you cry
Cuz there’s someone down there waiting who’s only goal in life
Is making you sure you’re always going to be alright
A loving angel tender tough and strong
It’s almost time to go and meet your Mom
Now when she’s talking to you
Make sure you listen close
Cause she’s gonna teach everything you’ll ever need to know
Like how to mind your manners to love and laugh and dream
And she’ll put you on the path that’ll bring you back to me
So hush now baby don’t you cry
Cuz there’s someone down there waiting who’s only goal in life
Is making you sure you’re always going to be alright
A loving angel tender tough and strong
Come on child it’s time to meet your Mom",Tenderness
Alan Jackson,Country,The Older I Get,,2017.0,"The older I get
The more I think
You only get a minute, better live while you’re in it
'Cause it’s gone in a blink
And the older I get
The truer it is
It’s the people you love, not the money and stuff
That makes you rich

And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet

The older I get
The fewer friends I have
But you don’t need a lot when the ones that you got
Have always got your back
And the older I get
The better I am
At knowing when to give
And when to just not give a damn

And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet
The older I get


And I don’t mind all the lines
From all the times I’ve laughed and cried
Souvenirs and little signs of the life I’ve lived

The older I get
The longer I pray
I don’t know why, I guess that I
Got more to say
And the older I get
The more thankful I feel
For the life I’ve had, and all the life I’m living still",Sadness
