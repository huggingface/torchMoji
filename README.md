### ------ Update September 2018 ------
It's been a year since TorchMoji and DeepMoji were released. We're trying to understand how it's being used such that we can make improvements and design better models in the future. 

You can help us achieve this by answering this [4-question Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1h4NSQD30YM8dsbJQEnki-02_9KVQD34qgP9to0bwAHBvBA/viewform "DeepMoji Google Form"). Thanks for your support!

# ðŸ˜‡ TorchMoji

> **Read our blog post about the implementation process [here](https://medium.com/huggingface/understanding-emotions-from-keras-to-pytorch-3ccb61d5a983).**

TorchMoji is a [pyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of the [DeepMoji](https://github.com/bfelbo/DeepMoji) model developped by Bjarke Felbo, Alan Mislove, Anders SÃ¸gaard, Iyad Rahwan and Sune Lehmann.

This model trained on 1.2 billion tweets with emojis to understand how language is used to express emotions. Through transfer learning the model can obtain state-of-the-art performance on many emotion-related text modeling tasks.

Try the online demo of DeepMoji on this ðŸ¤— [Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Pendrokar/DeepMoji)! See the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00524), [blog post](https://medium.com/@bjarkefelbo/what-can-we-learn-from-emojis-6beb165a5ea0) or [FAQ](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/deepmoji/overview/) for more details.

## Overview
* [torchmoji/](torchmoji) contains all the underlying code needed to convert a dataset to the vocabulary and use the model.
* [examples/](examples) contains short code snippets showing how to convert a dataset to the vocabulary, load up the model and run it on that dataset.
* [scripts/](scripts) contains code for processing and analysing datasets to reproduce results in the paper.
* [model/](model) contains the pretrained model and vocabulary.
* [data/](data) contains raw and processed datasets that we include in this repository for testing.
* [tests/](tests) contains unit tests for the codebase.

To start out with, have a look inside the [examples/](examples) directory. See [score_texts_emojis.py](examples/score_texts_emojis.py) for how to use DeepMoji to extract emoji predictions, [encode_texts.py](examples/encode_texts.py) for how to convert text into 2304-dimensional emotional feature vectors or [finetune_youtube_last.py](examples/finetune_youtube_last.py) for how to use the model for transfer learning on a new dataset.

Please consider citing the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00524) of DeepMoji if you use the model or code (see below for citation).

## Installation

Assuming you have [Conda](https://conda.io) installed, run:

```bash
conda create -n torchMoji -f environment.yml
conda activate torchMoji
pip install -e .
```

This will install the following dependencies:

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
* [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
* [text-unidecode](https://github.com/kmike/text-unidecode)
* [emoji](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji)

If you do not want to use Conda, please install `torch==1.3.1` from PIP and then run `pip install -e .` from the root directory (don't forget to set up a virtual environment).

At the present stage the model can't make efficient use of CUDA. See details in the [Hugging Face blog post](https://medium.com/huggingface/understanding-emotions-from-keras-to-pytorch-3ccb61d5a983).

Then, run the download script to downloads the pretrained torchMoji weights (~85MB) from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8lax9ary32c7t9/pytorch_model.bin?dl=0) and put them in the model/ directory:

```bash
python scripts/download_weights.py
```

## Testing
To run the tests, install [nose](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). After installing, navigate to the [tests/](tests) directory and run:

```bash
cd tests
nosetests -v
```

By default, this will also run finetuning tests. These tests train the model for one epoch and then check the resulting accuracy, which may take several minutes to finish. If you'd prefer to exclude those, run the following instead:

```bash
cd tests
nosetests -v -a '!slow'
```

## Disclaimer
This code has been tested to work with Python 2.7 and 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04 and macOS Sierra machines. It has not been optimized for efficiency, but should be fast enough for most purposes. We do not give any guarantees that there are no bugs - use the code on your own responsibility!

## Contributions
We welcome pull requests if you feel like something could be improved. You can also greatly help us by telling us how you felt when writing your most recent tweets. Just click [here](http://deepmoji.mit.edu/contribute/) to contribute.

This code and the pretrained model is licensed under the MIT license.

## Benchmark datasets
The benchmark datasets are uploaded to this repository for convenience purposes only. They were not released by us and we do not claim any rights on them. Use the datasets at your responsibility and make sure you fulfill the licenses that they were released with. If you use any of the benchmark datasets please consider citing the original authors.
